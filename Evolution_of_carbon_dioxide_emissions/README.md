## Forewords

* Data Analysis done the following libs in python : pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, folium and basemap.
* Use of various datasets from different origins: 
  * evolution of carbon dioxide emissions per capita
  * population of countries for each year of the last decades 
* __Goals / questions answered__:
  * in which countries do people produce individually more CO2 ?
  * which countires are the most important emitters ?
